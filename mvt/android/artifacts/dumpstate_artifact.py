# The AOSP dumpstate code is available at https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/native/cmds/dumpstate/
# The dumpstate code is used to generate bugreports on Android devices. It looks like there are
# bugs in the code that leave some sections with out ending lines. We need to handle these cases.
#
# The approach here is to flag probably broken section, and to search for plausible new section headers
# to close the previous section. This is a heuristic approach, and may not work in all cases. We can't do
# this for all sections as we will detect subsections as new sections.
